Configuration
Set Up Your Private Key
The script reads your private key from a file named privatekey.txt.
Important:

Never share or commit your private key.
Create a file called privatekey.txt in the root directory of the project and paste your private key (as a plain text string) into it.
For example:

txt
Copy
Edit
0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
Review Contract Addresses and RPC URL
The script is pre-configured to connect to the Monad Testnet with the following settings:

RPC URL:
https://monad-testnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/dkEUofCC_DkGE0hb1qfcLosQeneQWmLc
Staking Contract Address:
0x2c9C959516e9AAEdB2C748224a41249202ca8BE7
gMON Token Address (for balance check):
0xaEef2f6B429Cb59C9B2D7bB2141ADa993E8571c3
If you need to change any of these (for example, if the addresses change or you want to use another network), update the values directly in the script.
